# OBSS-Code-Master-2022-Final-Round
Each competetor had 210 minutes to finish whole project. You can take a look to the definition of the work in CodeMasterFinal.pdf which is located in the definition folder. Also base and extended test results are included in 'test results' folder.

 I've used Spring Boot as framework, Jsoup library to get page information, Jackson ObjectMapper to return JSON.
